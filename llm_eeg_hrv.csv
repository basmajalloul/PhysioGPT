subject_0_394,Healthy,Healthy,"Conclusion: Healthy  
Explanation: The EEG shows persistent low alpha activity, but HRV is within a healthy range (SDNN = 60.74 ms). There is no strong EEG suppression or HRV suppression, meeting the criteria for a healthy classification.",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:26:45
subject_0_399,Healthy,Healthy,"Conclusion: Healthy  
Explanation: The EEG shows low alpha activity, but HRV is within a healthy range (SDNN = 54.35 ms). There is no strong EEG suppression or HRV suppression, meeting the criteria for a healthy classification.",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:26:51
subject_0_462,Healthy,Healthy,"Conclusion: Healthy  
Explanation: The EEG shows low beta and alpha ratios, but HRV is not suppressed (SDNN = 70.78 ms), indicating healthy autonomic regulation. The presence of normal HRV and no strong EEG suppression suggests a healthy classification.",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:26:57
subject_0_463,Healthy,MCI,"Conclusion: MCI  
Explanation: The subject exhibits low alpha ratios in multiple EEG regions, indicating alpha suppression, and HRV suppression with an SDNN of 28.49 ms. These findings meet the criteria for MCI as they include one strong EEG feature (alpha suppression) and HRV suppression.",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:27:02
subject_0_468,Healthy,Healthy,"Conclusion: Healthy  
Explanation: The EEG shows persistent low alpha activity, but the HRV is within a healthy range (SDNN = 65.70 ms). According to the ontology, healthy autonomic regulation (SDNN ≥ 50 ms) with no strong EEG suppression detected supports a classification of Healthy.",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:27:09
subject_0_475,Healthy,Review,"Conclusion: Needs clinical review  
Explanation: The EEG shows persistent alpha suppression, which is an abnormal feature. However, the HRV is not significantly suppressed (SDNN = 34.49 ms), which does not meet the criteria for MCI. The findings are partially abnormal but not conclusive for a definitive classification.",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:27:19
subject_0_476,Healthy,Review,"Conclusion: Needs clinical review  
Explanation: The EEG shows persistent low alpha activity, indicating potential cognitive decline, but HRV is not significantly suppressed (SDNN = 36.61 ms). The findings are partially abnormal but not conclusive for MCI.",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:27:24
subject_1_397,MCI,Review,"Conclusion: Needs clinical review  
Explanation: The EEG shows persistent alpha suppression and beta suppression, indicating potential cognitive decline. However, HRV is not significantly suppressed (SDNN = 41.39 ms), which does not meet the criteria for MCI. The findings are partially abnormal but not conclusive for a definitive classification.",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:27:30
subject_1_455,MCI,MCI,"Conclusion: MCI  
Explanation: The subject exhibits low beta ratios across multiple EEG sites, indicating beta suppression, and HRV suppression with an SDNN of 23.77 ms. These findings meet the criteria for MCI, as there are two abnormal features co-occurring: beta suppression and HRV suppression.",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:27:35
subject_1_456,MCI,MCI,"Conclusion: MCI  
Explanation: The subject exhibits low alpha activity across multiple EEG channels and low beta activity, alongside HRV suppression (SDNN = 20.55 ms). These findings meet the criteria for MCI, with at least two abnormal features co-occurring (alpha↓, beta↓, HRV↓).",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:27:40
subject_1_457,MCI,MCI,"Conclusion: MCI  
Explanation: The EEG shows persistent alpha suppression, and the HRV indicates reduced autonomic flexibility with an SDNN of 25.03 ms. These findings meet the criteria for MCI with two abnormal features co-occurring (alpha↓, HRV↓).",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:27:46
subject_1_459,MCI,MCI,"Conclusion: MCI  
Explanation: The subject exhibits low beta activity across multiple EEG sites, indicating beta suppression, and HRV suppression with an SDNN of 28.56 ms. These findings meet the criteria for MCI as they include one strong EEG feature (beta suppression) and HRV suppression.",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:27:52
subject_1_461,MCI,MCI,"Conclusion: MCI  
Explanation: The subject exhibits low alpha and beta ratios, indicating alpha suppression and beta suppression, along with HRV suppression (SDNN = 24.81 ms). These findings meet the criteria for MCI, as there are at least two abnormal features co-occurring (alpha↓, beta↓, HRV↓).",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:27:58
subject_1_464,MCI,MCI,"Conclusion: MCI  
Explanation: The subject exhibits low alpha activity across multiple EEG sites, indicating alpha suppression, and HRV suppression with an SDNN of 27.69 ms. These findings meet the criteria for MCI as they include one strong EEG feature (alpha suppression) and HRV suppression.",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:28:04
subject_1_467,MCI,MCI,"Conclusion: MCI  
Explanation: The subject exhibits low beta ratios across multiple EEG channels, indicating beta suppression, and HRV suppression with an SDNN of 27.87 ms. These findings meet the criteria for MCI as they include one strong EEG feature (beta suppression) and HRV suppression.",gpt-4o,2025-11-08 23:28:08
